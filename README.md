# Certstatus
Bash script that check the status of the certificates url and alert the time of expiration date. I will give you back a file with the result.

* Create a file with the list of domains to be check
* chmod 755 the script certstatus.sh
* Run the script $./certstatus.sh
* It will ask you for the path of the file that contains the urls/domains to be check
* As result will generate a file in /tmp folder by the name of domainsOUT-"an the actual date"
* Enjoy
